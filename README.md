# credit-card-fraud-detection-using-different-ML-models
Problem Statement:
Assume that you are employed to help a credit card company to detect potential fraud cases 
so that the customers are ensured that they won’t be charged for the items they did not purchase. You 
are given a dataset containing the transactions between people, the information that they are fraud or 
not, and you are asked to differentiate between them. This is the case we are going to deal with. Our 
ultimate intent is to tackle this situation by building classification models to classify and distinguish 
fraud transactions.


Dataset Used for: The data we are going to use is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset 
(click here for the dataset). It contains features V1 to V28 which are the principal components 
obtained by PCA. We are going to neglect the time feature which is of no use to build the models. The 
remaining features are the ‘Amount’ feature that contains the total amount of money being transacted 
and the ‘Class’ feature that contains whether the transaction is a fraud case or not. 
Context 
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so 
that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
Content 
The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. 
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 
transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all 
transactions.
